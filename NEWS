*** 2007-??-?? - DreamChess v0.2.0 ***

It has taken us roughly a year, but DreamChess v0.2.0 has finally been
released. The main new feature is sound support. Be sure to download the
music pack by Matthew P. Smith from our website at http://www.dreamchess.org.

Another addition is the new easy mode, for those who felt that our Dreamer
engine put up too much of a fight in v0.1.0. Graphically there have been a
number of small changes, e.g. the pieces now reflect in the chess board.

We hope you enjoy this new release.

*** 2006-09-24 - DreamChess v0.1.0 ***

DreamChess (http://www.dreamchess.org) is an open source chess game. Our
primary target platforms are Linux, Windows, Dreamcast and BeOS. DreamChess
features 3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board sets, ranging
from classic wooden to flat figurines.

A moderately strong chess engine is included: Dreamer. However, should this
engine be too weak for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible
chess engine, including the popular Crafty and GNU Chess.

Other features include on-screen move lists using SAN notation, undo
functionality, and savegames in PGN format. In future releases we plan to add
support for time controls, audio, network play, more visual effects such as
reflections and shadows, and 3D animated pieces. If you're interested in
helping out, please head on over to http://www.dreamchess.org for more
information, and/or send an email to feedback at dreamchess.org.

We hope you enjoy the game!
